# Software development course for IoT systems

Assignments and projects as part of a software development course for IoT systems in Python. At the couse, we used MQTT IOT protocol with paho-mqtt python package. In the repository you can find GUI app as a common client with basic abilities to Connect, Publish and Subscribe. We used the website http://www.hivemq.com/demos/websocket-client/ as a broker for the data transfer.

* Auxiliary scripts for emulators and GUI.
* Working with databases and editing them using SQLite.
* "Smart Home Manager" project using the emulators and the gui, and manages sending the data to the db.
* From "Smart Home Manager" that we used as a basis, we chose to execute a smart air conditioner that can be controlled and change its state and temperature with the help of the sensors/emulators.
